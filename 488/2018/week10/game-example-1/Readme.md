#### Intro
A **Shoot Em Up**, or **STG** in Japan, style game simply allows a player to fire bullets and other weapons at an enemy, whilst trying to avoid their attack.

The classic example, of course, is **Space Invaders**, which largely popularised this genre of game.

However, there are many different examples of this style of game.

#### Different types
Whilst the general gameplay is the same for each type of STG, there are a few notable variants. For example, we may consider viewpoint and movement as an easy way of differentiating various different examples. These may include,

  * fixed shooters
  * rail shooters
  * scrolling shooters
  * ...

#### Game versions
The following versions are available:

##### Music/Basic
  * v0.9 - shooter0.9.py
    * add music and sound effects to the game window
      * add pygame mixer
      * load sounds directory in assets
      * load required sounds and sound effects
      * call `play()` for each required sound effect and game music...
