#### Intro
A **Shoot Em Up**, or **STG** in Japan, style game simply allows a player to fire bullets and other weapons at an enemy, whilst trying to avoid their attack.

The classic example, of course, is **Space Invaders**, which largely popularised this genre of game.

However, there are many different examples of this style of game.

#### Different types
Whilst the general gameplay is the same for each type of STG, there are a few notable variants. For example, we may consider viewpoint and movement as an easy way of differentiating various different examples. These may include,

  * fixed shooters
  * rail shooters
  * scrolling shooters
  * ...

#### Game versions
The following versions are available in this directory:

##### Sprites/Graphics
  * v0.4 - shooter0.4.py

        * images for player's ship, ship's laser, and meteors
