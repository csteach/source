### Week 12 - Source code examples

The source code for week 12 can be found in the following directories,

  * 424-node-json1
  * 424-node-json2
  * 424-node-mongo1
  * 424-node-redis
  * 424-node

Please ensure you have installed Node.js, and it is working correctly. Then install required dependencies for each application.

For MongoDB and Redis based apps, you'll also need to ensure that Mongo and Redis are running before you can connect your app.

Each of the above apps, excluding `424-node-mongo1`, is detailed in the week 12 notes.
