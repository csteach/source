    "note": "Cannes, a resort town on the French Riviera, is synonymous with glamour thanks to its world-famous film festival. Its Boulevard de la Croisette, curving along the coast, is lined with sandy beaches, upmarket boutiques and palatial hotels. It’s also home to the Palais des Festivals, a modern building complete with red carpet and Allée des Stars – Cannes’ walk of fame."

    "note": "Nice, capital of the French Riviera, skirts the pebbly shores of the Baie des Anges. Founded by the Greeks and later a retreat for 19th-century Europe’s elite, the city today balances old-world decadence with modern urban energy. Its sunshine and liberal attitude have long attracted artists, whose work hangs in its museums. With vibrant markets and diverse restaurants, it's also renowned for its food."

    "note": "Antibes is a resort town between Cannes and Nice on the French Riviera (or Côte d’Azur). It’s known for its Mediterranean beaches, annual Jazz à Juan music festival and old town enclosed by 16th-century ramparts. Luxury yachts moor at the huge Port Vauban marina, overlooked by star-shaped, 16th-century Fort Carré. The Promenade Amiral-de-Grasse walkway along Vauban’s walls has views of the Alps."
